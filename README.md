## Reddit Saves Classifier

### Overview

Reddit allows users to save posts for later use. However, finding those posts later on is cumbersome.
As someone who saves a lot of posts and dosn't always read  them in a timely manner, I would like to be able to catalog
and access older saved posts more easily.

This program will catalog all saved posts by subreddit, by month of the post, or by post type and place the URLs into
dedicated directories. The user can then choose to open any of the posts through their default browser.
